# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
Help Jeremy who works for AutosRUs to review the production data for insights on the newest prototype *MechaCar* that may help the manufacturing team understand the production troubles faced. We will help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:
1. No variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

2. The slope is not zero because the p-value of 5.35e-11 is lower than the 0.05 statistical significance. Which provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis of slope = 0.

3. We can say that the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the *r-squared value* is .7149, indicating about 71% of the variance has a strong association with mpg.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:
Per the *total_summary* dataframe below, we can confirm that the current manufacturing data meets the design specification as the variance of the supsension coils does not exceed 100, it is at 62.29.

However, breaking down the manufactoring data by looking at the *lot_summary* we can confirm that Lot 3 exceeds the 100 pounds per square inch limitation. Per the below you see that tha variance of lot 3 was much higher at 170.28.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils:

**ALL Lots T-Test**
![T-Tests_All_Lots](https://github.com/mavalenz/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/T-Tests_All_Lots.PNG)

In the t-test for all lots, we found that the p-value of 0.06 is higher than the assumed statistical significance of 0.05, which means the null hypothesis can be accepted as the results are not significant.

**Lot 1 T-Test**
![T-Tests_Lot1](https://github.com/mavalenz/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/T-Tests_Lot1.PNG)

In the t-test for lot 1, we found that the p-value is a at 1. This indicates similar to the ALL lots t-test where it is higher than the statisical significance showing we accept the null hypothesis.

**Lot 2 T-Test**
![T-Tests_Lot2](https://github.com/mavalenz/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/T-Tests_Lot2.PNG)

In the t-test for lot 2, we found that the p-value is at 0.6 which is also higher than the statistical significance and thus we accept the null hypothesis.

**Lot 3 T-Test**
![T-Tests_Lot3](https://github.com/mavalenz/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/T-Tests_Lot3.PNG)

In the t-test for lot 3, we found that the p-value is at 0.04 which is lower than the statistical significance, meaning we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition:
For many consumers, a big component for selecting cars would be safety and reliability of the car.
- Metrics to test for to compare safetyness against competitors would be safety ratings.
- The **Null Hypothesis** would be - MechaCar's safety ratings have no difference to its competitors and the **Alternative Hypothesis** would be vice versa of safety ratings are different.
- To test my hypothesis I would perform a **T-Test** because it will help me determine if there is a significant difference between the means of competitors.
- Data needed to run the statistical test would be safety ratings across competitors, car model, year, etc.
